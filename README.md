## Introduction

This project explores the San Francisco housing rental market to unearth potential investment opportunities. Utilizing data visualization tools, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, we delve into the intricacies of the San Francisco real estate market.

## Analysis Deliverables

Our Jupyter notebook comprises several key deliverables:
